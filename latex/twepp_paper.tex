\abstract{
The CMS collaboration is building a new inner tracking pixel detector for the High-Luminosity LHC.
Each pixel readout chip will be controlled with a single serial input stream at 160 Mbps and will send out data via four CML 1.28 Gbps outputs.
The readout chips will be grouped in modules and connected with up to 1.6 m long low-mass electrical links to Low-Power Gigabit Transceivers (lpGBT) and Versatile Link PLUS Transceivers (\vtrxp) modules that send the data optically to off-detector electronics at 10 Gbps.
The development and the characterization of these components is presented along with system tests of the readout chain.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will provide CMS with a peak instantaneous luminosity of $7.5 \times 10^{34} \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ starting in 2027.
Compared to the LHC, the HL-LHC will have up to 200 proton-proton collisions (pileup) per event and will shower CMS with a higher radiation fluence.
To prepare for this data taking environment, the CMS Tracker will be fully replaced in the Phase-2 upgrade~\cite{ref:tdr,ref:orfanelli}.

The new inner tracker will have about two billion silicon pixels installed.
The detector will be built using hybrid pixel modules that process sensor data using a custom readout chip (ROC) initially developed by the RD53 collaboration~\cite{ref:rd53}.
Each readout chip on the detector needs a control link to receive trigger, clock, commands, and settings from off-detector electronics as well as a data links to send pixel data to off-detector electronics.
The high bandwidth control and data links are split into two stages: electrical links and optical links.
System tests of electrical and optical links are presented.

\section{Data Readout Chain}
\label{sec:readout}

An overview of the data readout chain for the inner tracker is shown in figure~\ref{fig:readout}.
High bandwidth electrical and optical links are used to establish control and data links between pixel modules on the CMS detector and Data Trigger Control (DTC) boards in the counting room.
Low-mass electronic links (e-links) up to 1.6 meters long provide 160 Mpbs control links (downlinks) and 1.28 Gbps data links (uplinks) between pixel modules and portcards.
Optical fibers connect portcards, which are mounted on the support structure inside the detector, to DTC boards in the counting room to establish 2.5 Gbps control links (downlinks) and 10 Gbps data links (uplinks).
The portcards are printed circuit boards that each carry three Low-Power Gigabit Transceivers (lpGBT) and three Versatile Link PLUS Transceivers (\vtrxp) modules~\cite{ref:lpgbt,ref:vtrxp}.
The lpGBTs convert optical signals to electrical signals (and vise versa), and the \vtrxp\space modules establish optical links with the DTC boards.

% Each wire has a 36 AWG copper core (127 microns in diameter) surrounded by a polyimide coating for insolation (45 micron thickness); the total diameter is 217 microns.
%
% Polyimide braiding is used to lash twisted pairs in a bundle to provide durability and prevent wire kinks.

% Different epoxies tested: Araldite 2011 and UR 6060.
% Final epoxy used: UR 6060.

One end of a twisted pair electrical link (e-link) is shown in figure~\ref{fig:elink}.
Five twisted pair channels (one for a control link and four for data links) are lashed together in a bundle using a polyimide braiding.
The lashing provides durability and prevents wire kinks.
Each twisted pair has two wires that are twisted together with 4 twists per inch.
On each end of an e-link, wires are soldered to a paddle board, and a nonconductive epoxy (UR 6060) is applied to secure the wires.
Each wire has a 36 AWG copper core (127 microns in diameter) surrounded by a polyimide coating for insolation (45 micron thickness); the total diameter is 217 microns.

% E-link testing

% TODO: expand description of tests

% The tests performed on e-links are continuity, visual inspection, mass measurement, DC resistance, differential eye diagram, bit error rate tests (BERT), impedance measurements, cross talk, thermal cycling, and radiation.

The prototype low-mass electrical links are being developed and characterized with a series of measurements.
The signal quality is assessed using eye diagrams to quantify the amplitude and jitter as well as identifying any distortion.
Bit error rate scans are using to characterize signal integrity across e-links.
Cross talk effects from channels within an e-link bundle and from multiple bundles is studied.
The RD53 chip on a Single Chip Card (SCC) is readout over e-links using an FC7.
Bit error rates are measured using the RD53 chip, and different signal amplitudes for the RD53 are tested to quantify the effect on the error rate.

Radiation testing was performed to determine if e-links can maintain performance after receiving up to 1500 MRad, which surpasses the total does expected during their use in CMS.
Two different epoxies, Araldite 2011 and UR 6060, were used for e-links that underwent radiation testing.
For doses up to 1300 Mrad, the Araldite 2011 epoxy showed significant darkening, while the UR 6060 epoxy remained clear and transparent.
The signal integrity on e-links remained good after radiation doses.
The polyimide braiding used for lashing becomes brittle after 1900 MRad, but this should not effect the electrical readout.

% ==================
% E-link performance
% ==================

The readout of the RD53A chip across e-links is tested using an FC7, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:tap0_vs_length}.
E-links of two gauges (34 and 36 AWG) and different lengths (from 0.35 to 2.0 meters) are used to readout the RD53A chip.
Bit error rates are determined using a pseudorandom bitstream (PRBS).
The RD53 signal amplitude is varied using the TAP0 setting.
Longer e-links require a larger signal amplitude to maintain a given bit error rate.
Good performance is seen for e-links up to 2.0 meters.

% For e-links of different lengths, the TAP0 setting to achieve a bit error rate of $10^{-11}$ errors per second is measured (right).
% The necessary signal amplitude increases with e-link length as expected.
% Good performance is seen for e-links up to 2.0 meters.
}
\end{figure}

% Crosstalk measurements

An external crosstalk measurement was performed, and the results are shown in figure~\ref{fig:external_crosstalk}.
To mitigate the effect of external crosstalk from a large aggressor amplitude, the victim amplitude set by TAP0 only requires a small increase.
Thus, external crosstalk from the single aggressor e-link has a small effect on readout over the victim e-link.

\section{Portcards with Optical Links}
\label{sec:optical}

The portcards play an important role in the readout chain in converting electrical signals from on detector ROCs to optical signals for off detector DTC boards.
The portcard design is shown in figure~\ref{fig:port_card_design}, and photos of a prototype portcard are shown in figure~\ref{fig:port_card_pics}.
Dedicated setups with the portcards reading out single ROC cards with short coaxial cables have been used to test the prototype portcard and validate the optical part of the readout chain.

\end{figure}

% Optical Link Measurements

The optical links have been characterized by various measurements.
In one measurement, the high-speed input to the lpGBT is compared to a 5-bit adjustable constant voltage by a comparator sampled with a phase interpolated clock.
Transitions of the comparator are counted; within the eye the output should toggle, but above or below the eye, no transitions are expected.
The data from this measurement are shown in figure~\ref{fig:lpgbt_eye}.
The high toggle count region is large, corresponding to a large eye diagram and a strong optical signal.

% TODO: Discuss other optical link measurements

}
\end{figure}

% Electrical Link Measurements

The electrical link receivers on the lpGBT are being studied.
In one measurement, the signal source is a PRBS7 generator in the RD53A readout chip.
This signal sent over a commercial display port cable, an adapter board, and a Molex FPC cable to be received by an lpGBT.
The signal is compared to an internal error checker on the lpGBT.
The bit-error rate is measured as a function of clock sampling phase and equalization setting, and the results are provided in figure~\ref{fig:lpgbt_bert}.
The phase at the eye crossing is clearly seen, demonstrating the quality of the electrical signal.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The data readout chain is an important part of the CMS Phase-2 pixel upgrade.
Various system tests have been performed to characterize the electrical and optical links that form the readout chain.
Electrical links can provide stable links at the required lengths, and crosstalk has a small effect on signal quality.
Conversion from electrical to optical links is working well, and the optical links have good performance.
% Current studies demonstrate good performance of electrical and optical links.
These results will inform the final design, production, and testing of components for the pixel detector readout chain.
